# BSG Bladerunner

This repository tracks releases of the HammerBlade source code and
infrastructure. It can be used to:

* Simulate HammerBlade Nodes of diverse sizes and memory types

* Generate HammerBlade [Amazon FPGA Images](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/)

* Create [Amazon Machine Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)
  with pre-installed tools and libraries

## HammerBlade Overview

HammerBlade is an open-source manycore architecture for performing
efficient computation on large general-purpose workloads. A
HammerBlade is composed of nodes attached to a general purpose host,
simliar to a general-purpose GPU. Each node is a single an array of
tiles interconnected by a 2-D mesh network attached to a flexible
memory system.

HammerBlade is a Single-Program, Multiple-Data (SPMD) architecture:
All tiles execute the same program on a different set of input data to
complete a larger computation kernel. Programs are written in the
CUDA-Lite lanaguage (C/C++) and executed on the tiles in parallel
"groups", and sequential "grids". The CUDA-Lite host runtime (C/C++)
manages execution parallel and sequential execution. 

The HammerBlade is being integrated with higher-level parallel
frameworks and Domain-Specific Languages. A Pytorch
[Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) backend is being
developed to accelerate Machine Learning and a
[Graphit](https://github.com/GraphIt-DSL/graphit) code-generator is
being developed to support Graph Computations.

C/C++, Python, and Pytorch programs can interact with a Cooperatively
Simulated (Cosimulated) HammerBlade Node using Synopysis VCS or
Verilator. 
The HammerBlade Runtime and Cosimulation top levels are in [BSG
Replicant](https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/bsg_replicant)
repository.

For a more in-depth overview of the HammerBlade architecture, see the
[HammerBlade
Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wpdx0FykCyIAL3VdJEBz0tK-aQyChW0TKdHfbIXQJQI/edit).

The architectural HDL for HammerBlade is in the [BSG Manycore
Repository](https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/bsg_manycore) and
the [BaseJump
STL](https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/basejump_stl)
repositories. For technical details about the HammerBlade
architecture, see the [HammerBlade Technical Reference
Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2g2nnMYidMkcn6iHJ9NGjpQYfZeWEmMdLeO_3nLtgo)

To run simulated applications on HammerBlade, or build FPGA images
from this repository, follow the instructions below:

## Requirements

### CAD Tools

* To simulate with VCS you must have VCS-MX installed. (After 2019,
  VCS-MX is included with VCS)

* Verilator is built as part of the setup process.

* To simulate or compile our AWS design, you must have Vivado 2019.1
installed and correctly configured in your environment. The Vivado
tools must have the Virtex Ultrascale + Family device files
installed. See page 40 [in this
guide](https://www.xilinx.com/content/dam/xilinx/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2019_1/ug973-vivado-release-notes-install-license.pdf)
If you are using Vivado 2019.1 you will need to apply the following AR
before running simulation: https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/72404.html.

The Makefiles will warn/fail if it cannot find the appropriate tools.

### Packages

Building the RISC-V Toolchain requires several distribution
packages. The following are required for CentOS/RHEL-based
distributions:

```libmpc autoconf automake libtool curl gmp gawk bison flex texinfo gperf expat-devel dtc cmake3 python3-devel```

On debian-based distributions, the following packages are required:

```libmpc-dev autoconf automake libtool curl libgmp-dev gawk bison flex texinfo gperf libexpat-dev device-tree-compiler cmake build-essential python3-dev```


## Setup: VCS (No AWS Simulation)

**Non-Bespoke Silicon Group (BSG) users MUST have Vivado and VCS installed before these steps**

The default VCS environment simulates the manycore architecture, without any closed-source or encrypted IP. 

1. [Add SSH Keys to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). 

2. Initialize the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. (BSG Users Only: `git clone git@bitbucket.org:taylor-bsg/bsg_cadenv.git`)

4. Run `make -f amibuild.mk riscv-tools`


## Setup: Verilator (Beta)

Verilator simulates the HammerBlade architecture using C/C++ DPI
functions instead of AWS F1 and Vivado IP.

1. [Add SSH Keys to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). 

2. Initialize the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. Run `make verilator-exe`

4. Run `make -f amibuild.mk riscv-tools`


## Setup: VCS (AWS)

**Non-Bespoke Silicon Group (BSG) users MUST have Vivado and VCS installed before these steps**

VCS simulates the FPGA design that is compiled for AWS F1 and uses Vivado IP.

1. [Add SSH Keys to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). 

2. Initialize the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. (BSG Users Only: `git clone git@bitbucket.org:taylor-bsg/bsg_cadenv.git`)

4. Run `make aws-fpga.setup.log`

5. Run `make -f amibuild.mk riscv-tools`
