# BSG Bladerunner

This repository tracks releases of the HammerBlade source code and
infrastructure. It can be used to:

* Compile and Simulate FPGA Designs

* Generate [Amazon FPGA Images](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/)

* Create [Amazon Machine
  Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) with
  manycore tools and libraries-preinstalled.

## [Makefile](Makefile) targets

* `checkout-repos`: Clone submodule repositories that are needed for the
  Manycore/Bladerunner project.

* `build-ami` : Builds the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and emits the AMI ID.

* `build-tarball` : Compiles the manycore design (locally) as a tarball

* `build-afi` : Uploads a Design Checkpoint (DCP) to AWS and processes it into
  an Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) with an Amazon Global FPGA Image ID (AGFI)

* `print-ami` : Prints the current AMI whose version matches `FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION`
  in [Makefile.common](Makefile.common)

## File List

* [Makefile](Makefile) provides targets cloning repositories and building new
Amazon Machine images.

* [Makefile.amibuild](Makefile.amibuild) provides targets for building and
installing the manycore tools on a Amazon EC2 instance. Indirectly used by the
target `build-ami` in [Makefile](Makefile).

* [Makefile.common](Makefile.common) defines paths to each of the submodule
dependencies

## Instructions

### F1 Cosimulation

To run cosimulation see the instructions in COSIM.md

### Build an Amazon FPGA Image (AFI)

These steps will build the FPGA image and upload it to AWS. `FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION`
will be used as the value for the 'Version' key in AFI Tags. The new AFI/AGFI
IDs are printed on the command line and in upload.json.

1. Clone this repository.

2. Update the `FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` variable in [Makefile.common](Makefile.common)
to avoid naming conflicts. (`FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` will be used as the value for the
'Version' key in the AMI and AFI Tags.)

3. Run `make build-afi` from inside this repository. 

The new AFI/AGFI IDs are printed on the command line and in upload.json.

### Build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
   
These steps will build the Machine image and upload it to
AWS. `FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` will be used as the value for the 'Version' key in AMI
Tags.

1. Clone this repository.

2. Update the `FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` variable in [Makefile.common](Makefile.common)
to avoid naming conflicts. (`FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` will be used as the value for the
'Version' key in the AMI and AFI Tags.)

3. Commit changes and push to a branch. (This step is critical!)

4. Run `make build-ami` from inside this repository. 

### To Make a Release
   
These steps will build an AMI and an AFI and upload them to
AWS. It is a combination of the steps above.

1. Clone this repository.

2. Update the `FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` variable in [Makefile.common](Makefile.common)
to avoid naming conflicts. (`FPGA_IMAGE_VERSION` will be used as the value for the
'Version' key in the AMI and AFI Tags.)

3. Run `make build-afi` from inside this repository. (See the section Build an
Amazon FPGA Image)

4. Replace the `AGFI_ID` and `AMI_ID` variables in
[Makefile.common](Makefile.common) with the new values in upload.json (generated
by the previous step).

5. Commit your changes and push to a branch

6. Run `make build-ami` from inside this repository. (See the section Build an
Amazon Machine Image)

7. Test the release
    
8. Make a PR to `dev` or `master` depending on the state of the release.

9. Apply a tag to the release when it is merged to master
